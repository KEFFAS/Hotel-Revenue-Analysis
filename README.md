# Hotel-Revenue-Analysis
A project to develop a SQL database and to analyze and visualize hotel booking data using Power BI

## Project Overview

The purpose of this data analysis project is to offer insights on hotel revenue during the previous years. We aim to detect patterns, obtain a more profound comprehension of the hotel's financial performance, and formulate evidence-based suggestions by scrutinizing many facets of the hotel data.

## Data sources

The main dataset included in this analysis is the "hotel_revenue_historical.xlsx" file, which includes comprehensive data regarding hotel reservations and revenue generated.
